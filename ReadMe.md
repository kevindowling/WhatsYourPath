# What's Your Path

## Overview of final product

This project is dedicated to building a web application that allows users to create, store, and manage quizzes and then access the quizes via an api endpoint. It integrates user authentication, a powerful quiz creation interface, database connectivity for data persistence, and RESTful API endpoints for data access. Additionally, it features an AI assistant to streamline quiz creation and enhance user engagement. Although, it will be possible to build knowledge focused quizzes, the focus of this app will be more geared towards quizzes like "MBTI" or "Find a Career". 


## Tech Stack

- **Backend**: Python with Django for the core application logic, Django REST Framework for API development, MongoDB for data storage, and TensorFlow or PyTorch for AI functionalities.
- **Frontend**: HTMX for dynamic content, Bootstrap for styling, Vanilla JavaScript for client-side logic, and Fetch API or Axios for making HTTP requests.

## How to Set Up Your Development Environment

1. **Install Dependencies**: Use `pip` for Python packages and `npm` or `yarn` for JavaScript libraries.
2. **Database Setup**: Ensure MongoDB is running and configure the connection string in the project settings.
3. **Run the Development Server**: Use Django's built-in server for local development and testing.
