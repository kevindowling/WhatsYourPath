# Decision-Based Quiz Creation Web App

## Overview

This project is dedicated to building a web application that allows users to create, store, and manage decision-based quizzes and then access the quizes via an api endpoint. It integrates user authentication, a powerful quiz creation interface, database connectivity for data persistence, and RESTful API endpoints for data access. Additionally, it features an AI assistant to streamline quiz creation and enhance user engagement.


## Tech Stack

- **Backend**: Python with Django for the core application logic, Django REST Framework for API development, MongoDB for data storage, and TensorFlow or PyTorch for AI functionalities.
- **Frontend**: HTMX for dynamic content, Bootstrap for styling, Vanilla JavaScript for client-side logic, and Fetch API or Axios for making HTTP requests.

## How to Set Up Your Development Environment

1. **Install Dependencies**: Use `pip` for Python packages and `npm` or `yarn` for JavaScript libraries.
2. **Database Setup**: Ensure MongoDB is running and configure the connection string in the project settings.
3. **Run the Development Server**: Use Django's built-in server for local development and testing.
