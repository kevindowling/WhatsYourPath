# What's Your Path

## Overview of final product

The final product is planned to be a 3d game where the player is walking a path. Quiz questions will appear above the path and the answers will be forks in the road. The game will pull quizzes from an API endpoint at my pathfinderquizzes.com website. 


## Tech Stack

- **Backend**: Python with Django for the core application logic, Django REST Framework for API development, MongoDB for data storage, and TensorFlow or PyTorch for AI functionalities.
- **Frontend/Website**: HTMX for dynamic content, Bootstrap for styling, Vanilla JavaScript for client-side logic, and Fetch API or Axios for making HTTP requests.
- **Frontend/Game**: Still deciding on if it should be made using Unity or a web framework like Three.js
