### OBJECTIVE
   - Create a web app where users can create quizes and post the quiz to a database. I want to create an api for accessing the quizes. I want an endpoint that gets all the quizes available and I want an endpoint for getting a quiz by the ID. The quizes that will be made there will be more decision based and not knowledge based (Example: "Find the Right Career" quiz). I may offer an AI assistant to help build the quiz

### Steps to Create a Web Application for Quizzes:

1. **Research the Correct Tech Stack**
   - Identify project requirements and constraints. `DONE`
   - Research suitable backend and frontend technologies. `DONE`
      - Django. MySQL or SQLite. HTMX. 


2. **Build the Data Model for the Quizzes**
   - Identify entities (e.g., Quiz, Question, Answer, User). `DONE`
   - Define attributes and relationships for each entity. `DONE`
   - Decide on data types, constraints, and indexes. `DONE`
   - Design database schema and create tables accordingly. `DONE`
   - Create models for quizzes, questions, answers, and users. `DONE`

3. **Build the Database**
   - Create the database schema using SQL. `DONE` (For SQLite as final option)
   - Create the database schema using MySQL. `DONE` 
   - Deploy the database
   - Test the database functionality.

4. **Build the Backend of the Application**
   - Define API Endpoints `DONE`
   - Implement CRUD operations and API endpoints.
   - Implement authentication, authorization, and error handling.
   - Write unit tests and document the backend API.

5. **Build the Frontend of the Application**
   - Setup project structure and design user interface.
   - Integrate with the backend using API requests.
   - Implement state management, user interactions, and styling.
   - Ensure responsiveness, accessibility, and localization.
   - Write tests for components and user flows, and document the frontend architecture.
